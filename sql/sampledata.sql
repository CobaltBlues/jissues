This is being done because Joomla currently loads all of the JavaScript files first, then loads all of the JavaScript declarations afterwards.

It''s a bit rough but it gets the job done.  As I explain in my training, the major advantage in doing it this way is that you design layouts for components and modules in the same way so you get the escape method and also cool things like $this->baseurl, etc.  There are some Easter eggs in the layout of that example module as well, but I''ll leave you to find them :)\r<br>\r<br>As for a recommendation, I''m agnostic about whether you use JView or just apply a quick fix with htmlspecialchars.

There is no PHP method to know jQuery version being loaded.\r<br>3. There is no management of conflicts between different versions of the javascript libraries\r<br>4. It is a pull request at CMS level for PLATFORM feature ?\r<br>\r<br>FYI: These 3 problems were solved in Joomla Platform pull request here:\r<br>https://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/pull/736\r<br>\r<br>Final solution should have best parts of each the 2 proposals merged imho.', '2012-02-03 15:58:55'),
(3799909, 116, 'AmyStephen', '@rcorral said "The reason for creating a plugin is to avoid all of the support that the Joomla team would have to do by supporting another JS library."\r<br>\r<br>Initially, when I read that comment, I was encouraged, assuming that meant the JS files would not be included with core, a position I very much support. However, after review, I see that the files are actually included which, in my thinking anyway, implies the same degree of support for jQuery as is provided for Mootools. \r<br>\r<br>I think your registration concept is on the right track, but not the plugin, nor the inclusion of jQuery. I''d encourage you to beef up the API a bit and include a version, as Beat is indicating. Then, make certain the API provides adequate interface for extension devs to determine whether or not files exist that can simply be reused, or the extension needs to load those files. Nothing more than that, though, IMO.\r<br>\r<br>It would be great to see the administrator template bundling the UI layer with the CSS, etc., whether it''s Bootstrap and jQuery, or MTs and Mocha, it''s more of a frontend developer choice and a adopting a JS-agnostic goal to help keep those options open will be very helpful for Joomla users.

This could be added, although I didn''t think it was necessary, as the register function allows you to [override the previous value](https://github.com/rcorral/joomla-cms/commit/47e208d8468851df3775205dc5bc6126ac55853d#L0R68). This way developers can just add the jquery library from their extension, but not override it in case the jquery plugin is already enabled.\r<br>3. Honestly, I don''t even this is necessary, it adds unnecessary overhead. Joomla doesn''t maintain old versions of other javascript libraries, nor does it allow you to load old versions of mootools. You are stuck with the version that it ships with, and I think that fine. It is best to keep up with the latest and greatest. As another note, jquery is much better about backwards compatibility than other libraries.\r<br>4. The plugin would need to get accepted by the CMS, but I would also need to submit a pull request for the platform changes.

In all cases the bottleneck on mobile is the download weight, especially on 3G connections due to the huge lag. All of my devices didn''t even blink parsing jQuery and mooTools. But, yes, if we could get Joomla!''s own JS to be jQuery based it would be slightly better.<br><br>Regarding CDNs, I agree with you. But! The more sites using the same file from the same CDN the more likely is the browser caching the file. I will tell you my unscientific, very objective findings so far. Ever since I had Kickstart load jQuery off a CDN people have been telling me how much faster it is. It would be interesting to have analytics about that, but I have no idea where to look or start.<br><br>In any case, even if the cache was busted and we ended up loading one copy of jQuery during the user''s first visit it would still be better than the typical site I see today. In the typical site we have at least two extensions loading two different jQuery versions. In this case, 80Kb with a single HTTP request guaranteed to get cached in the following page loads is better than 2 * 80Kb HTTP requests which most usually won''t get cached because there is neither an Expires not an Etag header. Of course if someone is merely using stock Joomla! it will make the page slightly heavier, by 80Kb. Well, we do get the option, as extension developers, to choose whether we want to load jQuery, don''t we?', '2012-06-10 20:10:56'),
(6231497, 218, 'jlleblanc', '@realityking Thanks for the clarification on data attributes. I stand corrected.<br><br>I believe the plan is to get as much of the frontend core JavaScript converted to jQuery as possible first. This way, MooTools won''t be required to load and can be pulled in on an as-needed basis. If we can get everything converted over to jQuery for Joomla 3.0, that would be ideal, but it might also be too aggressive of a timeline.<br><br>Long term, MooTools will most likely continue to be available in core for legacy code, just pulled in only when necessary. Obviously, having two libraries load is not ideal, but we can make an effort to ensure it isn''t the norm.<br><br>And yes, there will always be people out there shipping code relying on out of date versions of jQuery, no matter how much we beg for people to upgrade.

If the attribute is present, then the user agent must assume that the resource is of the given type (even if that is not a valid MIME type, e.g. the empty string). If the attribute is omitted, but the external resource link type has a default type defined, then the user agent must assume that the resource is of that type. If the UA does not support the given MIME type for the given link relationship, then the UA should not obtain the resource; if the UA does support the given MIME type for the given link relationship, then the UA should obtain the resource at the appropriate time as specified for the external resource link''s particular type. If the attribute is omitted, and the external resource link type does not have a default type defined, but the user agent would obtain the resource if the type was known and supported, then the user agent should obtain the resource under the assumption that it will be supported.<br><br>User agents must not consider the type attribute authoritative — upon fetching the resource, user agents must not use the type attribute to determine its actual type. Only the actual type (as defined in the next paragraph) is used to determine whether to apply the resource, not the aforementioned assumed type.<br>```<br><br>By obtaining the actual type is not content sniffing meant but relying on the ``Content-Type`` header.<br><br>For the script element (which is more relevant because it gets trickier):<br>```<br>The type attribute gives the language of the script or format of the data. If the attribute is present, its value must be a valid MIME type. The charset parameter must not be specified.
